1. 	For all this projects in this repo I will be using Spring tool suite (STS) which is based on eclipse and
	specially designed to work on spring applications.
2.  To create an application I use the STS create new spring project UI which makes an API call to download 
	required dependency from spring Initializer (https://start.spring.io/)
